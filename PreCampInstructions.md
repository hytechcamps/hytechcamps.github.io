# Virtual Pre-Camp Instructions
Please read through these instructions before the night of the camp. Most of the instructions apply to all virtual camps - however, some instructions are for specific sessions. Be sure to note the specific instructions for the camp you will be attending.

## Recommendations
- We recommend a desktop or laptop computer for all virtual camps.
- If you have multiple devices available, it will be beneficial to join the Zoom meeting from one device, and code using a separate device. For example, if you have two laptops, you could join the Zoom meeting from one of the laptops, and do the activities on the other laptop.
- A Chromebook could be used, but it may not give you the best experience. An ideal situation for a Chromebook user would be to also have access to a laptop or desktop to use as a second device. That said, if you do not have any other devices, we hope you still try to participate as best you can! 
- We do not recommend using a phone or tablet as your main device for the virtual Hy-Tech Camp. This is because the size of those screens may make it difficult to participate in the activities.

## Before the Meeting
1. Download [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) onto your device if you do not already have it installed.
1. Make sure you can properly open the tool for your camp on your device. Check below to see which tools are needed.

## During the Meeting - Presentation & Kahoot/Blooket
1. During the lecture portion, the instructor will share their screen through Zoom. Keep the window maximized to participate.
1. If there is a Kahoot quiz or Blooket game, the questions will appear in the Zoom meeting, but you will have to answer the questions elsewhere.
   - If you have a phone or another device, we recommend using that device to answer the questions. Instructions will appear on the screen in the Zoom meeting.
   - If you only have one device, you can open a new web browser window and follow the instructions to join the game from there. We can help you get everything set up.

## During the Meeting – Follow-Along: Single Device
The most difficult setup will be for the follow-along. The ultimate goal is for you to see both the instructor's screen and your own screen at the same time.

1. In the Zoom meeting, move your cursor to the top of the screen and hold it there. A menu bar should appear. From there, click on "View Options" and then "Exit Full Screen":

1. Move the Zoom meeting to the left side of your screen, and adjust the size of the window so it only takes up the left half of the screen.
1. Open up the code editor or other camp tool in a web browser.
1. Move the web browser window to the right side of the screen, so both the Zoom meeting and the web browser window (code editor) are visible:

1. Adjust as needed. You should be able to see the code from the instructor's screen AND your own screen.

If desired, it is also possible to switch between the Zoom window and the web browser window throughout the follow-along.

## During the Meeting – Follow-Along: Multiple Devices
If you have multiple devices, use one device to view the Zoom meeting, and another device to follow along.
