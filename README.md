## Parent/Guardian Consent Form
Before participating in any Hyland Tech Outreach programs, it is necessary for a parent/guardian of any student under the age of 18 to complete a Consent Form. Only one form will be necessary for the duration of the summer, so if you've completed one for a previous Hy-Tech Camp this year, you do not need to complete another one!

[Click here to access the form online.](https://unityforms.onbase.com/HSIDB/UnityForm.aspx?d1=AXqj5WtCdyBSP534QS%2bymO7giKPJqgRe0JvlfCPbrVKTSQ5CeLzlqyJqSFofoXf2%2fLm1tziXizPoWedY3oo0Ff8BYz3%2bWSDjX8JsPBVEQ68sFTg%2be%2bztiTe7qXhuFsIP6RVeH4uaoVUZvOwoGP5MJdybqMRrkdlPg7n0HQq%2b03fYaGCHuMTrcgd3xVYRQTtHcGVbF%2f9ge37RyeSM6tW3DNOA6Rk1qQ%2bwqehGr6BqXkDl4Hizr1%2bMzCdHnpVWatT87A%3d%3d&_ga=2.25243006.2103430845.1587136770-78961992.1520540426)
